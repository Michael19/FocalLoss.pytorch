# Focal Loss 

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002)

This is a focal loss implementation in pytorch.



### Simple Experiment

Running results from the `train.py`.

Also compared with [imbalanced-dataset-sampler](https://github.com/ufoym/imbalanced-dataset-sampler), and it seems that it is much better to use balanced sample method if your task can use it (eg. classification).
